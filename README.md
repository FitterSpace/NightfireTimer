# 007: Nightfire (GameCube) On-screen timer
This lua script displays the in-game timer on-screen. Made for use with the Dolphin 5.0 Lua Core.

## How to Use:

1) Download the latest version of [Dolphin 5.0 Lua Core](https://github.com/SwareJonge/Dolphin-Lua-Core)
2) Download this script and place it in the "Scripts" folder (Sys > Scripts)
3) Start running the North American version of 007: Nightfire in the emulator
4) While the game is running, go to Tools > Execute Script
5) Find "NightfireTimer.lua" in the drop-down list and click "Start"

The timer will only display when you're in a level. It doesn't do anything in the menus.
Once you go into a stage, you should see the in-game timer at the top corner of the screen.
